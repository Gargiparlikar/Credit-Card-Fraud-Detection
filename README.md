# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


## Project Overview
This project identifies fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The dataset is highly imbalanced, so SMOTE oversampling is used to balance the classes before model training.

## Dataset
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

## Features
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Scaling
- SMOTE Oversampling
- Random Forest Classifier
- Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, ROC-AUC)

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SMOTE

## Results
The model achieved strong fraud detection recall while maintaining balanced precision.

## How to Run
1. Download dataset as `creditcard.csv`
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook
